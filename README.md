# Rock, Paper, Sand! the Media Tracker

Rock, Paper, Sand! is a text-based media tracker for TV shows, movies, and
potentially other types of media. It will hopefully soon support advanced
filtering for things like showing all TV shows or movies from the user's list
that are both complete (i.e., no pending sequels or future seasons) and
completely available to stream at no additional cost on the user's existing
streaming services.

## What's with the name?

Rock, paper, and sand are all used in different types of physical filters, and
filtering is one of the main focuses of this program.

## Use cases

Supported:

*   None yet, check back later.

Near-term goals:

*   Advanced filtering of a list of media:
    *   Show all TV shows or movies that both have no upcoming sequels/seasons
        and are completely available at no additional cost on the user's
        existing streaming services.
    *   Show all movies that are currently in theaters and not available to
        stream.

Mid-term goals:

*   Generating reports from a list of media using more than just filtering:
    *   Filter for TV shows or movies are complete and not available on the
        user's existing streaming services, then group by what streaming
        services they are on. (To make it easy to pick a new streaming service.)
*   Integrate with local libraries' APIs if possible, to find which TV shows or
    movies can be borrowed from the library.

Potential future goals:

*   Better support for other types of media, like books.
*   Some sort of graphical user interface.
*   Recommendations for other media to watch/read/etc.
